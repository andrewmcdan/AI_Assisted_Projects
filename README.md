# AI Assisted Projects

This repository catalogs my projects in which I used AI to generate much of the code. Each project demonstrates different use cases and applications where AI-assisted development proved valuable.

## Projects

### Web Applications
- [AI Document Interview System](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/AI-Document-Interview-System) - Uses an LLM (OpenAI's GPT-4.1) to create a searchable and interviewable database of information from unstructured data like PDF's and Word Docs.
- [AI Research Assistant](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/Research-Assistant) - Automated research AI that scours the web for relevant information for the topic you want to research.

### Embedded Systems
- [CDeck RasPi](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/CDeck-RasPi) - Software that runs on the RasPi in my RasPi / LoRa Cyberdeck.
- [CDeck ESP32](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/CDeck-ESP32) - Firmware for the ESP32 in my RasPi / LoRa Cyberdeck.
- [Workbench Screens](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/Workbench-Screens) - A modular C++ application intended to run on a Raspberry Pi that drives one or more LCD panels on an electronics workbench.

### Tools & Utilities
- [Movie Library Analyses](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/Movie-library-analyses) - Tool to do some basic analysis on a Plex Movie library.
- [ChatGPT history Viewer](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/ChatGPT-History-Viewer) - Desktop utility for browsing exported ChatGPT conversations entirely offline.
- [Movie Picker](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/Movie-Picker) - Interactive Plex movie picker that uses OpenAI's GPT models to interview you about what you're in the mood to watch.
- [MultiViewer PiP Contoller Window](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/multiviewer-pip-window) - This app controls an Orei HDMI multivewer device. Using PiP mode and a moveable and resizeable window, we emulate having a live view of a connected HDMI device on the desktop.

### Books
- [Post-Collapse Systems](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/Post-Collapse-Systems) - What happens when the world ends? How do we build back the world we once knew?
- [Survival Guide](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/Survival-Guide) - Basic survival manual for the end of the world.
